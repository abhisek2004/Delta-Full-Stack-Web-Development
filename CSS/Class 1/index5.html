        <p>
            The G20, or Group of Twenty, is a prominent international forum consisting of 19 of the world's largest
            economies and
            the European Union. Key topics related to the G20 include global economic stability, trade policies,
            financial
            regulations, and addressing economic inequalities. Climate change and sustainable development are also
            central themes,
            as G20 nations collaborate on environmental initiatives and sustainable economic growth. Additionally,
            the G20 plays a
            crucial role in coordinating responses to global crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Geopolitical
            issues, like
            international security and conflicts, often find their way into G20 discussions, highlighting its
            importance in shaping
            global governance and cooperation.
